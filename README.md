## Apple's Metal example code, hugely simplified and translated to Swift

In case it helps anyone, I translated this from Apple's Objective-C example
[Selecting Device Objects For Compute Processing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/gpu_selection_in_macos/selecting_device_objects_for_compute_processing).
I pared it down quite a bit too, because I ran into trouble with it and decided to ask for help
on StackOverflow. For which, many thanks to [Tyler](https://stackoverflow.com/users/988260/tyler)
for his brilliant [help](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61742070/macos-metal-app-works-in-obj-c-fails-to-draw-in-swift-translation).

I think it's more-or-less self-explanatory, or maybe I'm just too busy to write a nice, useful
description of it, or maybe just too lazy. Anyway, build and run, it's fun to watch.
